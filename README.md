### Comprehension Combinators for Go

This is a Go library that provides a set of functions for working with slices and maps. The library follows a functional and combinator-style approach, allowing you to compose and sequence operations in a type-safe and modular way.

### Features

* Slices: Functions for filtering, finding, mapping, and sorting slices of various types.
* Maps: Functions for working with maps, including extracting keys and values from maps.
* Type Safety: Generics are used effectively to ensure type safety, making the code more robust and flexible.
